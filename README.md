# 📊 ITSM Incident Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of incident management within IT infrastructure using data science techniques. The main objectives are to:
1. 🛠️ **Predict ticket priority** to take preventive measures.
2. 📈 **Forecast incident volume** to aid in resource planning and technology management.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source:** Extracted from the kaggle ITSM Incident Management Process (ServiceNow).
- **Size:** 141,712 events, 24,918 incidents with 36 attributes.
- **Key Attributes:** Incident state, priority, urgency, resolved time, etc.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Data:** Various techniques were used to clean the dataset.
- **Encoding:** Applied Label Encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical values.
- **Standardization:** Standardized numeric features to ensure consistent scaling.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed the distribution of incident priorities and trends over time.
- Key insights guided the selection of predictive models.

## 🤖 Modeling and Prediction
- **Classification Models:** SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor.
- **Time Series Forecasting:** ARIMA model used for forecasting incident volumes.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Results:** Included confusion matrix for classification and ARIMA forecast plots.

## 📊 Results and Discussion
- The models successfully predicted ticket priority and forecasted incident volumes.
- The project provided actionable insights for IT infrastructure management.

## 🔮 Future Work
- Explore more advanced models, such as deep learning, for improved accuracy.
- Incorporate real-time data for continuous monitoring and prediction.
